Questions about the user's experience with navigating campus that would impact how we design this project:

    - How little detail can we give in directions for the user to still be able to navigate campus? 
        Can we just give them a list of room names in the order they should go through them?
    - How often will people want a seperate route than the one we provide? And how do we build in a 
        feature that essentially is "give me another route"?


In the future possibly have a feature which will allow the user to select a node or edge they would like to toggle as a way to
get the algorithm to give them another route if they find the one provided to them unsatisfactory.
